# Build-a-Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "Legacy Front End" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.
